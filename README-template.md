### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources

-Fireship(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qhaz36TZG5Y&ab_channel=Fireship) This channel helped me understand Css much easier and I learned that I could clamp the content instead of making meadia queries. I really his style of explaining things and that he is using gifs in his videos that make it more understandable(and sometimes funny).
- Ihatetomatoes(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNVM5UxlFSA&ab_channel=Ihatetomatoes) - This is another amazing channel which helped me, when I ran into a problem with merging my branch to the main branch. I'd recommend it to anyone who thinks git is too complicated to learn.
